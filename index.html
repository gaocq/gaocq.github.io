<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Greatings! My name is Chenqiang Gao (高陈强). I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.cug.edu.cn/"> China University of Geosciences (CUG) </a>, Wuhan, China, in 2004 and Ph.D. degree, supervised by<a href="http://aia.hust.edu.cn/info/1126/3568.htm"> Jinwen Tian(田金文)</a>, from Institute of Image Recognition & Artificial Intelligence (图像所), <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/"> Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) </a>, Wuhan, China, in 2009. In August 2009, I returned to my hometown and joined School of Communications and Information Engineering at <a href="http://english.cqupt.edu.cn/"> Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT) </a>, Chongqing, China. In 2010, I spent an impressive year teaching middle school students in a village town for the Aid Education Program sponsored by the government. In September 2011, I became a associate professor at CQUPT. In September 2012, I joined the  Informedia Group in School of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/"> Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) </a>, working on Multimedia Event Detection (MED) and Surveillance Event Detection (SED) with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alex/">Prof. Alexander G. Hauptmann</a> as a visiting scholar. In April 2013, I became a Post Doctoral Fellow and continued work on MED and SED until March 2014 when I returned to CQUPT. I spent a wonderful period of one and a half year at CMU. I am now a professor at CQUPT, leading the <a href="https://cquptimg.github.io/"> Intelligent Media Group (IMG) </a> at CQUPT.
